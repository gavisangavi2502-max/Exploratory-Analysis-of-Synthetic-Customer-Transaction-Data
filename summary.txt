This project performs an exploratory analysis of a synthetically generated customer transaction dataset consisting of 500 records. The reproducible data generation uses a fixed random seed and produces three customer segments (A, B, C), timestamps within a one-year range, and PurchaseAmount values sampled from a Gamma distribution to mimic the right-skewed nature of transaction amounts. 

Segmented descriptive statistics were calculated (mean, median, standard deviation) to characterise spending behaviour. The computed statistics are: Segment A — Mean 195.92, Median 183.22, Std 93.74; Segment B — Mean 194.40, Median 184.01, Std 88.30; Segment C — Mean 207.46, Median 196.21, Std 92.68. 

These numbers indicate that one segment has the highest average purchase amount while another shows greater variability, suggesting differences in typical spending and heterogeneity within segments. A histogram was produced to visualise the overall distribution, which confirms right skew (more frequent mid-range purchases with a tail of larger transactions). A bar chart comparing segment statistics highlights the relative differences in mean and median across groups and helps identify which segments may be targeted for different marketing strategies. 

All outputs (data.csv, stats_output.txt, results.txt, histogram.png, bar_chart.png) are included in the project bundle for reproducibility and submission purposes.
