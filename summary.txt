 This project analyzes synthetic customer transaction data by generating 500 reproducible records containing segment labels, purchase amounts, and transaction dates. The dataset is inspected for structure, and descriptive statistics—including mean, median, and standard deviation—are computed for each customer segment. The analysis highlights differences in purchasing behavior across groups. A histogram visualizes the overall distribution of purchase amounts, revealing skewness typical in transaction data, while a bar chart compares segment statistics, showing how average spending varies across categories. These insights demonstrate foundational data analysis, statistical summarization, and visualization skills.
