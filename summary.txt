Summary of Exploratory Analysis (Synthetic Customer Transaction Data)

This project generates a synthetic dataset of 500 customer transactions with fields:
TransactionID, CustomerSegment, PurchaseAmount, and TransactionDate.

Descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation were calculated for each segment (A, B, C).
Patterns observed:
- Segment averages differ slightly due to random distribution.
- Purchase amounts follow a normal distribution.
- Visualizations show typical bell-curve distribution and clear segment-wise averages.
